Vinum documentation
===================

**Vinum** is a SQL processor written in pure Python, designed for
data analysis workflows and in-memory analytics.
Conceptually, Vinum's design goal is to provide deeper integration of
Python data analysis tools such as `Numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_,
`Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ or in general any Python code with the SQL language.
Key features include native support of vectorized Numpy functions and Python
functions inside of SQL queries.
